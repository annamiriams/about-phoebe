                <p>Phoebe was adopted from One Tail at a Time in February 2024. She is now returning to OTAT's care because whiel current guardians adore her, they aren't able to meet her needs long-term (they're a one-dog-only household). She is currently still with her guardians and together with OTAT, they are seeking either a foster or adopter for Phoebe (maybe you want to foster-to-adopt to see if it's a match?!).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Phoebe needs a foster or adopter who is WFH, retired, or able/willing to take her with them most places--at least for the foreseeable future and as she settles in with you. Phoebe needs a build-in dog friend at home with her to ease her separation anxiety.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Learn more about Phoebe and the foster/adoption process at One Tail at a Time's website by clicking on their logo! If you'd like to learn more about her, please email OTAT at adoptions@otatpdx.org or submit an adoption survey on their website and they'll be in touch!</p>
