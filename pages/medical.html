                <p>We’ve worked closely with Dr. Brittany Lauman at Brooklyn Yard Veterinary Hospital over the last year with
                    Phoebe. The team at Brooklyn Yard is wonderful and super committed to Phoebe’s success.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Shortly after we adopted Phoebe, she started having severe diarrhea regularly. We put her on several bland
                    diets (rice and various meats) before determining that she is intolerant of meat products. She has done well
                    on a hydrolyzed protein diet with only plant-based treats. She can tolerate a limited amount of dairy. Phoebe is incredibly food motivated, and will happily eat her kibble as treats. She also loves peanut butter and dehydrated cheese treats for a higher reward! </p>
                <br>
                <p>Over the last year, we’ve monitored some postural concerns. We noticed that Phoebe’s front legs knuckle, and
                    she sometimes shows a slight preference for her back left leg over her right and limps slightly. Phoebe was
                    evaluated by Dr. Roberto Novo at BluePearl Pet Hospital and he suggested that we continue to monitor the
                    situation. Some of Phoebe’s behaviors (noise sensitivity, growling when moved, jumpy greetings) have
                    indicated the possibility that she could be experiencing some underlying, undiagnosed pain. Thankfully, recent x-rays
                    came back normal!</p>
                <br>
                <p>We have also received significant support from Brooklyn Yard as we navigate Phoebe's generalized and
                    separation anxiety. We've discussed the possibility that her increased anxiety is also potentially pain
                    related. Phoebe's current med regimen aims to target both anxiety and pain, and any crossover between the
                    two. Phoebe is an absolute star when taking meds! Her future fosters/guardians will need to be/become comfortable administering medications, but Phoebe sure makes that easy! </p>
